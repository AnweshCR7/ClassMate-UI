# ClassMate
Need help managing all your classes at the university? Think it'd be great if someone kept a track of all your college related notifications? ClassMate provides a one stop solution to all things college by providing various tools to make one's college life a tad bit easier! 

There are 3 major components of this project. 
  - An Android based application (front-end):
  
    Use Android studio for this purpose. The application is almost completely functional although it does need some final finishing touches. However, and importantly so, I would like it to serve as a template or maybe a learning example in building an Android application involving ansycTasks for REST API calls. It has been kept simple and straightforward for the same reason. This is one of my early projects of which I am particularly proud ( and greatly thankful to my project partner: Pranay Deshmukh ). One may have a little difficulty in getting comfotable with all the files, activities, fragments, xmls and such... but do give it a try. I promise that it will be a good learning experience. I have purposely kept random data in it so that anyone who would want to use it, needs to pur at least some effort towards understanding the code. Enjoy!
    
  - The custom API:
  
    It was my first time writing an API for this project. I followed Ravi Tamada's blog for priliminary instructions as to how to create one. It is fairly straightforward to understand but quite an effort to learn and practise in reality. Altough, once you get the hang of it, it is quite fun too! http://www.androidhive.info/2014/01/how-to-create-rest-api-for-android-app-using-php-slim-and-mysql-day-12-2/
    Today you might want to explore newer, more recent tools to generate an API apart from the Slim Framework.
    
  - The backend Database:
  
    For the application to fetch data from the localhost, import the 'classmate.sql' file that I have uploaded. It sufficiently contains the database with all requisite tables. I have already made some entries in them so as to bring out the User Interface ( without pre-fed data the user Interface wouldn't be seen. Generally the password is qwerty but you can always signup! This is all locally managed. I have used WAMP for hosting my backend and Postman to check the URLs.
